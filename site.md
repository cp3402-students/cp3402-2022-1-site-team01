### A guide to managing the Jazz Townsville WordPress site.

#### Adding content
Adding content to the Jazz Townsville site is quite simple. Most content such as bands, events, and albums take the form of posts which can be added, edited, or deleted.

##### Bands
All band posts are displayed on the "Bands" page and are grouped in the "Bands" category. A single band post includes a title with the name of the band, a description of the band, and a featured image to be displayed.

##### Events
Similar to bands, with a title, short description, and featured image. Event posts are grouped in the "Events" category. Ensure a date, time, and location is present. The featured event post will be displayed on the front banner. Past events should not be displayed on the front sidebar.

##### Albums
One for each year. Albums have a special image associated with them, simply copy the image from the previous year, change the number, and upload. Set this new image as the featured image, but be sure to check the small box underneath the featured image to only display the featured image in a list, not on the post itself. The photo gallery for albums is done using the Jetpack plugin, and the block for the gallery is called "Tiled Gallery".

##### Pages
New pages may be added at will. The navigation menu may be modified in any way, but be sure to consider the complexities. As a general rule, no more than 3 clicks to access any page on the website. There are 3 templates for a page, two with sidebars, one without, and one with a top banner. Be sure to select the appropriate template on the right side.

#### Plugins

- __Jetpack__: a multipurpose plugin which we use to create photo galleries for albums.
- __Conditionally display featured image on singular pages and posts__: gives the ability to choose whether or not the featured image should be displayed on the single post itself.
